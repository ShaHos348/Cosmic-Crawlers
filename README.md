Cosmic Crawlers is an implementation of the game Dungeon Crawlers to the theme of Cats in Space written in Java using Android Studio for CS2340 Fall 2023. 

The game features 4 sections the player (as a astronaut cat) flies through to get to the spaceship while defeating 'ruff' enemies. Power-ups are also available throughout the map to help the player in their journey.
